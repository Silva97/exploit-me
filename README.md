# Silva97/exploit-me

This repository is an collection of challenges to write exploits and learn
some kind of cool stuffs about information security.

If you want to learn about AppSec, binary exploitation and/or exploit
development, this is the place.

## How to compile
If you want to compile some challenge you can just use the `Makefile` inside
of all challenge directories. But for commodity here has an `Makefile` on
root directory that can be used to compile any of the challenges.

Just run `make <chlg-number>` to compile it. For instance:
```console
$ make 001
```

## Using Docker
Doesn't want to download or run something on your computer? No worry, you can
use an [Docker] container to run the challenges.

If you want to build the Docker image just run `make docker-<chlg-number>`.
For instance:
```console
$ make docker-001
```

And to run the container:
```console
$ make run-001
```

### Running container without clone this repository

If you don't want to clone this repository to run the container, just run:
```console
$ docker run --rm -d --name "exploitme001" "silva97/exploitme001"
```

And to get the container's IP address:
```console
$ docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' exploitme001
```

## How to make the challenge
The objective to all challenges is write an exploit that is able to explore
the security issue on the challenge.

**Note**: You are free to read the code, reverse engineering the binary or do
anything you need to win the challenge. Your approach is more about what you
want to practice (code auditation, reverse engineering etc.).
