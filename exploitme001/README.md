## Description

This challenge is a simple server that gets login and password from client.
You should write an exploit to explore the use-after-free and gets access
without need to guess the password.

This server doesn't follow any standard protocol (like HTTP), it's just reads
direct the input from the socket. So you can use a client like netcat or some
custom client (for instance, developed in Python) to connect to server.
