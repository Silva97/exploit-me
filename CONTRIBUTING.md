# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this repository. Hope you can
learn something doing this.

## Writing contributions

To make an contribution to this repository:
1. Make a fork of this repository.
2. Make a new branch from the `develop` branch on your fork.
    - Use a descriptive name to branch, like: `add-exploitme999-challenge`
3. Push your new branch to your fork.
4. Open a pull request using `develop` as target from your branch.

## Submiting your solution

You are able to submit your challenge's solution for this repository on `solutions`
directory. Step by step:

1. Create directory to your solution named `solutions/{challenge}/{github-nick}`. Example:
   `solutions/exploitme001/Silva97`.
2. Add your exploit inside this directory if filename `solution.{ext}`. The
   file extension could be anyone. Examples: `solution.py`, `solution.sh`.
3. Add a `README.md` and say anything you want about the challenge. And
   don't forget the author(s) name(s).

The exploit should **only** print the flag in `stdout` and no more than it.
To check if your solution is working you can run the `tests.sh` script
in the root of this directory. The first argument to script is a filter
that could be used to run only your solution. Example:

```console
$ ./tests.sh exploitme001/Silva97
```

**Warning**: Your solution will only be merged if this test pass. And keep
in mind that the test will randomize the challenge's flag (but will follow
the `EME{...}` format).

## Changing an existing challenge

Before change any previous challenge, please think in mind that the challenge
should be exploited by the same way and using the same exploits.

If you make a code contribution to challenge (more than fixing typo or
anything like that) you are able to add your name to `Author(s)` list
of the challenge.

## Making a new challenge

To make a new challenge, please follow the steps:
1. Copy the `template` directory to the new challenge's directory.
    - For instance: `cp -r template exploitme999`
2. Edit the `README.md` inside the challenge's directory adding the required
  informations.
3. Edit the `Makefile` inside the challenge's directory as required.
    - Edit the `OUTBIN` default value.
    - Edit the `EME_CHALLENGE_FLAG` default value (`EME{...}`). This is the
      flag used on challenge by default (if not changed on compile-time);
    - Add new compiler's flags or any other required changes.

**Note**: You can use any programming language to write the challenge. But
remember that using a language other than C or C++ can break the
`Dockerfile` at the root of the repository.

## Writing the code

Challenges can also have their code audited (for those who like AppSec), so
the code should not have obvious flaws or comments/variable names that
hint at the security flaw.

For instance, this is a bad variable name:
```c
char vulnerableBuffer[32];
```
