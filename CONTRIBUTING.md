# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in contributing to this repository. Hope you can
learn something by doing this.

## Writing contributions

To make an contribution to this repository:
1. Make a fork of this repository.
2. Make an new branch from the `develop` branch on your fork.
    - Use a descriptive name to branch, like: `add-exploitme999-challenge`
3. Push your new branch to your fork.
4. Open a pull request using `develop` as target from your branch.

## Changing an existing challenge

Before change any previous challenge, please think in mind that the challenge
should be exploited by the same way and using the same exploits.

If you make an code contribution to challenge (more than fixing typo or
anything like that) you are able to add your name to `Author(s)` list
of the challenge.

## Making a new challenge

To make a new challenge, please follow the steps:
1. Copy the `template` directory to the new challenge's directory.
    - For instance: `cp -r template exploitme999`
2. Edit the `README.md` inside the challenge's directory adding the required
  informations.
3. Edit the `Makefile` inside the challenge's directory as required.
    - Remind to edit the `OUTBIN` default value.

**Note**: You can use any programming language to write the challenge. But
remember that using a language other than C or C++ can break the
`Dockerfile` at the root of the repository.

## Writing the code

Challenges can also have their code audited (for those who like AppSec), so
the code should not have obvious flaws or comments/variable names that
hint at the security flaw.

For instance, this is a bad variable name:
```c
char vulnerableBuffer[32];
```
